<!-- 6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years
and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
• Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside. . Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise,
display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
• Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages. -->

<!-- Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available
if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true; . Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday. Note: && has a higher priority than lI so you may need to use
brackets () to control which code gets done first.
• Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages. -->
